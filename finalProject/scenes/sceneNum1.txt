Local legend says that the old hotel in downtown Evergreen has hidden treasure!
At first I didn't believe in that old tale, specially when Bort is the one going around yelling how rich he'll be when he gets his grimy hands on it.

I packed my backpack and left that night.
I stole my dads old Flashlight, a map, a Snickers bar and a fidget spinner.


While scavenging I fell through the deteriorating floor.
Now I'm stuck inside a locked room in the basement...

The only thing I found is a pack of old cigarettes.
